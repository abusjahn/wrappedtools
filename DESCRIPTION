Title: Useful Wrappers Around Commonly Used Functions
Description: The main functionalities of 'wrappedtools' are:
    adding backticks to variable names; rounding to desired precision 
    with special case for p-values; 
    selecting columns based on pattern and storing their position, name, 
    and backticked name; computing and formatting of descriptive statistics 
    (e.g. mean±SD), comparing groups and creating publication-ready tables with 
    descriptive statics and p-values; creating specialized plots for correlation 
    or regression trees. Functions were mainly written for my own daily work or 
    teaching, but may be of use to others as well.
