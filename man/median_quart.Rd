\arguments{
\item{x}{Data for computation.}

\item{nround}{Number of digits for fixed round.}

\item{qtype}{Type of quantiles.}

\item{roundDig}{Number of relevant digits for roundR.}

\item{drop0}{Should trailing zeros be dropped?}

\item{groupvar}{Optional grouping variable for subgroups.}

\item{range}{Should min and max be included in output?}

\item{rangesep}{How should min/max be separated from mean+-sd?}

\item{rangearrow}{What is put between min -> max?}

\item{prettynum}{logical, apply prettyNum to results?}

\item{.german}{logical, should "." and "," be used as bigmark and decimal?}

\item{add_n}{Should n be included in output?}

\item{ci}{Should bootstrap based 95\% confidence interval be computed?}

\item{nrepl}{Number of bootstrap replications, defaults to 1000.}

\item{singleline}{Put all descriptive stats in a single element (default) or below each other. singleline = FALSE sets ci and add_n as TRUE}

\item{probs}{Quantiles to compute.}
}
\value{
Either character vector with median \code{[1stQuartile/3rdQuartile]} and additional results (singleline), or matrix with rows for n, median \link{CI} and quartiles, and optionally range.
}
\description{
Compute median and quartiles and put together.
